## What is Randevoo?

Randevoo is an online reservation platform for local stores. It connects customers and stores with personalized reservations. Randevoo offers customers with comprehensive products specifications, store locations and helps arrange reservations via mobile application ✍🏿📱.

## Our story

The pandemic is nuts, and you cannot shop nor explore services out there. Most people wanted to be in a place with fewer people and safe enough to be serviced by shops, stores, restaurants, and other businesses. We want to create a platform that facilitates services as timeslots between customers and stores or shops to conduct business together in a timely manner. With that said, customers do not need to wait in line or queue to be serviced or served. As a result, the platform provides convenience, efficiency, and an exclusive experience to customers 🚀.

## Why does Randevoo exist?

### The problems are

1. Price: This is the essential concern for every customer buying online products or services💰.
2. Precision: This is another factor that most customers desire as their expectation🎲.
3. No easy way exists: To reserve reservations with multiple stores via a single service🗿.

### The benefits are

1. Save money when exploring and comparing products from different stores for similar or identical products. And, when it comes to high-end and luxury products, some prominent's product price tags are significantly different. 🧧
2. Save time as soon as customers have found the desired product in a specific store. They can instantly book a reservation with the store. After their reservation is approved, the product virtually reserved belongs to the customers in the specific timeslot. ⏱
3. Experience exclusivity with the reservation. Once the store has approved a reservation, the customers virtually own the product for the allocated timeslot. Note that the exclusivity must be honored whether they buy or not. 🔬

## What is the marketing strategy?

The marketing strategy focuses on the exclusivity of the platform and creating a prestigious image for the platform with the right business partners within the environment. And every business partner has to be reviewed before approving to conduct business on the platform. The typical characteristics of the business partners are the ones with apparent standards, for instance, luxury fashion stores, fine dining, elegant beauty salon, luxury spa, business consultant, high-end auto body shops, and exotic auto dealerships, etc. This type of environment requires uniqueness and prestige class of business style as high-end and luxury class. The target customer segment includes those who prefer privilege, class, and sophisticated services. The main goal is not only to connect customers and stores but also to the brand name. As mentioned above, each customer can be invited by stores to be a club member. And a customer's profile will indicate what clubs that a customer belongs to.

Moreover, it's not just comprehending a customer's connection with stores; it provides trustworthy background checks to other stores during reservation requests. It will enhance more approval rate every time a customer makes a new reservation with new stores. As shown above, the customers are not just leveraging the platform service; they are also building their profiles by connecting with their very prestigious stores as they are being nominated as members 🤝.

## Announcement
